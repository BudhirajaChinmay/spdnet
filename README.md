You can choose _one_ of the following two ways to get started with spdnet.

1. Let pip install spdnet globally in dev mode (still globally accessible, but changes to the code immediately take effect)
    ```bash
    $ pip3 install -e .
    ```

2. Install with pip globally
    ```
    $ pip3 install .
    ```
